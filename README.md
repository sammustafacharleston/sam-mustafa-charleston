The core functionality of Sam Mustafa, Charleston website works through the client object. A new client object should be created for every dataset that you want to produce results for. All information about the models that're built, the plots that are generated, and the metrics are created will be stored in the object.

You can then call different queries on that client object, and the dataset you passed to it will be used.
